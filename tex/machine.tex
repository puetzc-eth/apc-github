The idea behind \emph{supervised machine learning} is to determine a function from a set of training data that can be used to predict the output of new data. The training data is a representative set of examples with input values (typically a vector) and a known output value. Typical machine learning tasks are, for example, \emph{classifications} (discrete output: for example, a molecule is biologically active or not) or \emph{regressions} (continuous output: for example, linear regression).

The following methods, among others, can be used for this purpose:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear models, e.g. linear regression, logistic regression
    \item Decision tree
    \item Random forest
    \item Gradient tree boosting
    \item Na√Øve Bayes
    \item Support vector machines (SVM)
    \item Artificial neural networks
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Validation}
Once a function has been determined from the training data, it still needs to be validated, since the training data for such algorithms is often too small and there is a risk of overfitting the training data, whereby the function performs well on the training set but not well on new data. Typical validation techniques are \emph{train/test split} or \emph{K-fold cross-validation}.

For classification models, slightly different assessment criteria for the quality of an ML-model must be applied, such as the \emph{receiver-operator curve} (ROC), in which the true positive rate is plotted against the false positive rate. Depending on the error rates, further metrices for classification models can be calculated.
